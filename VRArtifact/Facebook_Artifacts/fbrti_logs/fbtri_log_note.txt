Details: The second file (fbrti\_*.txt) contained the logs of control information for RTP\footnote{Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used in applications involving streaming media for the purpose of delivering audio and video over IP networks. RTCP carries the control information of RTP protocol.} sessions. The created file name indicated the date of recent login. The file also contained the encrypted username fragment and password of Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) connectivity. STUN is a tool used by ICE to discover the presence of a network address translator in case of remote hosts. From the fbrti\_*.txt file, we found that the agent is a lite implementation in terms of Session Description Protocol (SDP) connectivity. SDP is used for multimedia session initiation. The file also included the Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) attributes. Further analysis yielded forensically interesting results. In addition to all the above details, it also contained number of audio calls made, if the video was used in the call and number of peers interacted with. The RTP session info found in the file fbrti\_*.txt can be used to intercept traffic and potentially eaves drop on user calls. This makes the application potentially vulnerable to session hijacking and other attacks.
