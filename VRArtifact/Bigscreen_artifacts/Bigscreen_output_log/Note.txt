The output_log.txt also contained the timestamps of scene initialization.
The logs show user details and the ID's respectively. Given the Steam ID, profile details such as name, creation date, last login date, and location can 
be ascertained from a web database. The log contained details of the virtual room, administrator, screen sharing information, environment chosen, and the seating order. 
All the social activities performed during testing are reflected in the logs, thus giving the chance to interpret and reconstruct the incident that would have occurred.
